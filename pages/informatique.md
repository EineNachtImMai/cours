- > What you do is you put away your code, you don't try and write anything to deal with this.
  You look at the people who have been there before you...
  the people who have dealt with this before,
  the people who have built the spaghetti code,
  and you thank them very much for making it open source,
  and you give them credit, and you take what they have made and you put it in your program,
  and you never ever look at it again.
  *Because that way lies madness.*

- Alright then, keep your secrets
	- My all-time favorite comment in any codebase I ever worked on was:
	- >//  if you really have to know how this works, ask malik.
	- Malik is me. Thank god nobody ever asked, because I had no idea how it worked.
